ADR 0002: Content Management System SelectionStatus: AcceptedContext: Non-technical JOA board members need to update event details, election candidate bios, and news without touching code.Decision: Selected Strapi CMS (Headless) over PayloadCMS.Rationale: Strapi offers a more mature, ready-made Admin UI that requires zero custom code for basic content entry. Its built-in GraphQL support and robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allow us to differentiate between "Content Editors" and "System Admins" out of the box.Consequences: We are decoupled from the database layer of the CMS, which simplifies content management but adds an extra hop for data fetching (CMS $\leftrightarrow$ Next.js).
